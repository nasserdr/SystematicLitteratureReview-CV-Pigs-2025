# About

This repository contains the R code used to analyse data collected during a systematic literature review on the use of computer vision in 2D imaging for pig livestock farming.  
The associated research paper is titled:

**“The Use of Computer Vision in 2D Imaging for Pig Livestock Farming: A Systematic Literature Review.”**

At the moment, the code is not fully executable because the dataset is still proprietary. Once the paper is accepted, the dataset, code, and results will be released here as well.
